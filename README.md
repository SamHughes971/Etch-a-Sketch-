# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, I attempted to create a program that replicates an etch-a-sketch board. This project was difficult to complete and it required me to research different methods to complete it. Regardless, this project was enjoyable and made me think about how to approach each problem using a pen and paper to break the problem down. 

This project can be improved on in the future, for example, by adding options where the default color is not red.
